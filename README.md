# Data Preparation:

Gather your dataset which should include variables like sale date, sale price, house condition, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, square footage of the living space and lot, year built, and location coordinates.
Import the data into Tableau.

# Creating Visuals:

Use the data to create various visualizations such as:
A line graph for Daily Average House Sale Price.
Histograms for the distribution of house prices, bedrooms, and bathrooms.
A heat map to show the view versus condition of the houses sold.
A calendar view for selecting dates.
Filters for selecting months, square footage, and year built.

# Assembling the Dashboard:

Drag and drop the created visuals onto the dashboard space.
Arrange them logically to tell a story, like the example provided.
Ensure that filters and interactive elements are correctly set to affect the relevant visualizations on the dashboard.

# Adding Interactivity:

Enable dashboard actions like filter and highlight actions to allow users to interact with the data.
Test all interactive elements to ensure they work as intended.

# Final Touches:

Add titles, descriptions, and legends where necessary for clarity.
Make sure the dashboard is neat, readable, and aesthetically pleasing.
